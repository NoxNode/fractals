A 3D Game Engine with the following features:
- Forward rendering rasterization
- phong shading with directional lights (point lights WIP)
- normal mapping and parallax displacement mapping
- Text rendering
- load .obj or .dae 3d models (DAE models can include skeletal animations)
- 3d skeletal animation
- Raymarching rendering that can merge with the rasterizer to superimpose standard objects in a fractal world
- collision detection on arbitrary 3d convex objects with GJK
- convex hull decomposition (WIP)
- Reload game code while running
- UDP networking
- audio playback
